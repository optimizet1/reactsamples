To create a new React app, you can follow these command-line steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

2. **Create React App**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to globally install the `create-react-app` package:

   ```bash
   npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

3. **Create a New React App**: Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React app. Then, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app book-author-app
   ```

   Replace "book-author-app" with the desired name for your application. This command will create a new directory with the specified name and scaffold a new React app inside it.

4. **Change Directory**: Move into the newly created app directory:

   ```bash
   cd book-author-app
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the development server and launch the React app in your browser:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command will compile the app and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You'll see the default React app template.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a new React app. You can now start building your application by modifying the source code in the `src` directory. Changes you make will automatically update and reflect in the browser as you develop.v
